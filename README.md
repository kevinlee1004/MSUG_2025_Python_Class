# MSUG 2025 : Python Programming Training for Statistical Programmers and Statisticians

## Overview

This training is specifically tailored for **Statistical Programmers** and **Statisticians** with a **SAS programming** background.  
We recognize that transitioning to a new programming language can be daunting, especially for professionals who are deeply familiar with SAS.  
That's why this training not only introduces the foundational concepts of **Python**, but also highlights **key comparisons and similarities to SAS**, ensuring a smooth and relatable learning experience.

Whether you are a **beginner** or have **limited experience** with Python, this training will empower you to start programming in Python confidently.  
You will also be introduced to **Jupyter Notebook/Lab**, the most popular interactive environment for Python, making it easier to explore, experiment, and learn.

By the end of this session, you will have a **solid understanding of how Python can complement your SAS skills**, making you a more versatile and efficient Statistical Programmer or Biostatistician.
